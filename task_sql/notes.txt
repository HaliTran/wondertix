  Start the docker project
  Open PGAdmin and select 'Add New Server'
    Under the 'General' tab, give the server a name
    Under the 'Connection' tab:
      Set hostname/address to 'localhost'
      Verify Port is set to 5432
      Set username/password to the same values in your .env file (postgres default for both)
  Click save and you will be connected


To connect to the DB from docker command line:
  run 'psql -U postgres' to connect to the postgres server running in docker
